# ra_orbit

Attempt to model *Radioastron* orbit (ver. 2) accuracy vs. time. Accuracy is accessed via *total rate*
[cm/s] measured during successful correlation.
Model consists of normal noise, linear trend, harmonic component, and gaussian outliers distribution.
It results in linear trend consisting with balistic team measurements, harmonic component with ``T ~ 1
year`` (WTF?) and outliers at some catastrophic events (turning off H-maser, etc.)

Using ver. 2 of orbit and subsequent increase of accuracy accessed through *changepoint* problem.
